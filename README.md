# This is my first repository
This repository includes information about a project I completed in my Computational Thinking Course (BAIS:3020) during my sophomore year of college at The University of Iowa.

## Project Title
Top Movie of the Year Program

## Project Description
I was tasked with creating a python script that would access an external excel file containing information on performance of several domestic and international movies from 1916 to 2016. Each entry had information on the release year, budget, revenue, average rating, number of votes, and popularity. After accessing this file the program prompts the user for 3 inputs including the movie's release year, minimum average rating, and minimum average votes. The program will then tell the user what the most profitable movie was within that criteria.

## Tools Used
- Anaconda Navigator
  - GUI used to access the IDE
- Spyder
  - IDE used to run Python Code

## Files Used
I was provided with the excel data file [*top_movies.cvs*](https://iowa-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/jsmith326_uiowa_edu/Documents/Spring%202026%20Classes/Professional%20Preparation/top_movies.csv.xlsx?d=wd45ebd0f6f0545c1961fd52b9b75d90e&csf=1&web=1&e=twzwkf), by my professor, that contained the information my program would refrence.

I created the code [*The Movie of the Year Program*](https://iowa-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jsmith326_uiowa_edu/IQCrstHS-2WVQoayKUqY6OKgAdqI0tIWQ4p5HO0z7XhcC34?e=45PzU9) to access the [*top_movies.cvs*](https://iowa-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/jsmith326_uiowa_edu/Documents/Spring%202026%20Classes/Professional%20Preparation/top_movies.csv.xlsx?d=wd45ebd0f6f0545c1961fd52b9b75d90e&csf=1&web=1&e=twzwkf) and generate an output for the user.

## How to Run the Program
- Download the code and the excel file in the same folder.
  - If you do not download the documents in the same folder, the code will not run.
- Open the code using Spyder, there will be comments explaining what the code does at each step.
- Hit the '*run file*' button located at the top of the tool bar
- After you have started the program, it will prompt you for the movie's release year, minimum average rating, and minimum average votes.
- Enter the values you wish to see within the data set and the program will automatically generate an output.
- **_Congratulations!_** You have successfully ran the program.
